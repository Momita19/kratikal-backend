1. What is a Server?

- Imagine you have a toy box. Now, think of the server as a giant toy box that can send toys (information) to you whenever you ask for them.
How Does a Server Work?
You Ask for Something:

1. Let’s say you want to play with a toy car. You ask the server (the giant toy box) for a toy car.
Server Finds the Toy:

2. The server looks inside the toy box and finds the toy car you asked for.
Server Gives You the Toy:

3. Once the server finds the toy car, it gives it to you so you can play with it.

Why Do We Need Servers?
Without a server, you wouldn’t be able to get information, play online games, or even watch videos on YouTube. It’s like having a toy box with no toys in it!

So, in short:

Server = Big Toy Box that stores information.
You Ask the server for something.
Server Finds it.
Server Sends it to you.
And that’s how you get to play with your "toys" (or websites, games, and videos) whenever you want!

-- Node.js:

   1. Think of Node.js as the base of our toy box. It helps us build the box so that it can hold all our toys.

--Express.js:

    1. This is like adding compartments and drawers to the toy box. Express helps us organize how we store and retrieve toys.

-- Step 2: Adding the Toys (Data) to the Box
    -- MongoDB:

       -- MongoDB is where we store our toys (data). It’s like a big shelf where each toy has its own spot.
        Mongoose:

       -- Mongoose is like a librarian who helps us organize the toys on the shelf so that we can easily find them later.
